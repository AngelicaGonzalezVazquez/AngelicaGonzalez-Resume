        <p class="lead mb-4">I was born in Mexico and raised in the United States. My first language was Spanish and not until I was five years old I started to learn English. My only introduction to English before school was watching PBS Kids shows on television everyday. I clearly remember watching Sesame Street all the time and practicing my enunciation of different words with Elmo and his friends. Just like any other person trying to learn a new language, I struggled. I was one of the few students entering Kindergarten without knowing English or ever going to Preschool. Communicating with my peers and teacher was hard at the very beginning. At first, only hand signals allowed me to communicate with my teacher. There was a lot of pointing at things and saying “no” since it was the only work I knew and understood in English. Over time, I slowly began to grasp the English language and started to communicate with others verbally a lot more. I even found myself becoming a translator for my teacher when non speaking English parents had questions to ask the teacher. 

<br><br>

        I am currently a second year undergraduate student at the University of California, Riverside. During these two years at UCR, I have worked towards completing my masters in Liberal Studies. Liberal Studies is a major that allows one to part take in different subjects. Allowing me to take different courses of study have helped me in obtaining a well rounded education. I plan on using my liberal studies major to become a teacher in the future. So far, liberal studies has broaden my physical and social aspect of understanding people. My number one influence to becoming a teacher was my own kindergarten teacher and my experience. A teacher is like another parent to students. Teachers are responsible for taking care of them for eight hours a day and guiding them through educational up and downs. Teachers have the power to influence such young minds in a positive way. Growing up in a Hispanic-undocumented family, I noticed how my family had a lack of support when it came to navigating my brother’s and I’s education. Lucky enough our teachers provided amazing support not only to us, the students, but our parents who needed it the most. I want to be that support and positive influence for my future students and parents. A child’s education falls in the hands of their parents and teachers. 
<br><br>

        Although I am still pursuing my masters, I have had classroom experience in the past. While I was in middle school, once every week I would go to my old Elementary School and help my kindergarten teacher in her class. I was able to help her students learn their words and numbers. I learned that teaching a young child meant one had to have a lot of patience. To my surprise I was able to have a lot of patience. Thanks to my aunt who is also a kindergarten teacher. I have learned to put together homework packets and grade student’s work.
